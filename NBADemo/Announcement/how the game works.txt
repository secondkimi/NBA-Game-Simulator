1, pause(time) depends on a random number between 10 - 24 sec.
2, every time we start a new run first new check which team has the ball
3, the end of a run: 
A, splash, CHANGE BALL POSITION

B, hit the rim and DEF Rebound, CHANGE BALL POSITION
C: hit the rim and OFF Rebound, DO NOT CHANGE BALL POSITION
D: turnOver, change BALL POSITION

before pause(), print the result of this play

public void run() {

pause(time);
}


The logic of a play call:
based on playmaking and star player, decide which player get the ball
The player will:
A, drag a foul and go for free throw (probility depends on agressiveness(to set up))
if so, apply "free throw ability(to set up)" to make points
REBOUND REQUIRED if he missed the second one.
print(player A make 1/2 free throw, who get the rebound(if miss the second) );

B, turnOver
print( someone missed the ball, recovered by XXX);

C: two point / three point throw
print(player A made/miss a two/three point shot and player B recovered the rebound )
